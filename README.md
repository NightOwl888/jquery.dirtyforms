![Dirty Forms Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snikch/jquery.dirtyforms/master/branding/dirty-forms-logo.png)

Dirty Forms is a jQuery plugin to help prevent users from losing data when editing forms.

Dirty Forms will alert a user when they attempt to leave a page without submitting a form they have entered data into. It alerts them in a modal popup box, and also falls back to the browser's default onBeforeUnload handler for events outside the scope of the document such as, but not limited to, page refreshes and browser navigation buttons.

Oh, and it's pretty easy to use.

```javascript
$('form').dirtyForms();
```

Existing solutions were not flexible enough, so I wrote this to make sure that all of our use cases at Learnable would be supported. This included using TinyMCE as a rich text editor and ensuring dirty tinymce instances mark their form as dirty. I've also ensured that event bubbling on links and forms are propagated correctly. Dirty Forms will only attempt to alert the user if the event has not had the preventDefault() method called, and will accordingly refire events if the user chooses to continue from the page - ensuring all click handlers, and form submission handlers are correctly fired. For this reason, Dirty Forms should be the last jQuery plugin included, as it needs to be the last bound handler in the event stack (except of course for Dirty Forms [helpers](#helpers) and [dialog modules](#dialogs)).

The jQuery `.on()` method (or `.delegate()` method in jQuery prior to version 1.7) is used to attach click and submit handlers so even elements that are introduced to the page after the page has loaded, e.g. loaded dynamically through AJAX, will be handled correctly, and a 'form stash' was created to capture and save event targets at the beginning of the event / decision stage so that elements that are no longer in the DOM can still have events fired on them (e.g. when a form is in a modal box, then the modal box is replaced by the Dirty Forms confirmation, the form will be stashed, and if the event is refired, it will be added back to the DOM then have the event triggered on it).

## Features

- Supports multiple forms.
- Works on forms of any size.
- Wide browser support.

- Falls back to the browser's dialog (if the browser supports it).
- Pluggable helper system that reads and updates the dirty state of common rich text editor frameworks (optional).
- Event handler customization (for IFrame support).
- Small size (about 6 KB minified).
- Universal Module Definition (UMD) support for AMD, Node/CommonJS, Browserify, etc.
- Hosted on jsDelivr CDN for easy combining of modules into a single HTTP request.

## Usage

```javascript
// Enable for all forms
$('form').dirtyForms();

// Enable for just forms of class 'sodirty'
$('form.sodirty').dirtyForms();

// Enable Debugging
$.DirtyForms.debug = true;

// Select all forms that are dirty, and set them clean.
// This will make them forget the current dirty state and any changes
// after this call will make the form dirty again.
$('form:dirty').dirtyForms('setClean');

// Rescan to sync the dirty state with any dynamically added forms/fields
// or changes to the ignore state. This comes in handy when styling fields
// with CSS that are dirty.
$('form').dirtyForms('rescan');

```

## Ignoring Things

Set the `ignoreSelector` option to ignore specific fields, anchors, or buttons.

```
$('form').dirtyForms({ ignoreSelector: 'a.ignore-me'});
```

Alternatively, add the value of `$.DirtyForms.ignoreClass` to any elements you wish to ignore, and Dirty Forms will ignore them.

```javascript
$('#ignored-element').addClass($.DirtyForms.ignoreClass);
```

If you want to ignore more than one element at a time, you can add the value of `$.DirtyForms.ignoreClass` (with the default value `dirtyignore`) to a containing element.

```HTML
<div class="dirtyignore">

    <!-- Everything here will be ignored - anchor, input, textarea, and select -->

</div>
```

And of course that means if you ignore the topmost element on the page, you will effectively disable Dirty Forms.

```
$('html').addClass($.DirtyForms.ignoreClass);
```

You can re-enable elements so Dirty Forms watches them again simply by removing the ignore class.

```
$('html').removeClass($.DirtyForms.ignoreClass);
```

## Options

The following options are available to set during declaration of `.dirtyForms()` or alternatively via **$.DirtyForms.OPTIONNAME = OPTIONVALUE** or get via **OPTIONVALUE = $.DirtyForms.OPTIONNAME**.

```javascript
$('form').dirtyForms({ title: 'Warning!!' });

// OR

$.DirtyForms.title = 'Warning!!';
```

| Name  | Type  | Default  | Description  |  
|---|---|---|---|
| **title**  | string  | `Are you sure you want to do that?`  | Sets the title of the dialog (JavaScript/CSS dialog only).  |  
| **message**  | string  | `You've made changes on this page which aren't saved. If you leave you will lose these changes.`  | Sets the message of the dialog (whether JavaScript/CSS dialog or the browser's built in dialog - note that some browsers do not show this message).   |   
| **dirtyClass**  | string  | `dirty`  | The class applied to elements and forms when they're considered dirty. Note you can use this to style the elements to make them stand out if they are dirty (or for debugging).  |  
| **listeningClass**  | string  | `dirtylisten`  | The class applied to elements that are having their inputs monitored for change.  |  
| **ignoreClass**  | string  | `dirtyignore` | The CSS class applied to elements that you wish to be ignored by Dirty Forms. This class can also be applied to container elements (such as `<div>` or `<form>`) to ignore every element within the container.  |  
| **ignoreSelector**  | string  | `''` | A jQuery selector that can be set to ignore specific elements.  |  
| **fieldSelector**  | string  | `input:not([type='button'],[type='image'],[type='submit'],[type='reset'],[type='file'],[type='search']),select,textarea` | A jQuery selector indicating which input fields to include in the scan. |  
| **choiceContinue**  | bool  | `false`  | Set to true from the dialog to indicate to continue execution of the link or button that was clicked or false to cancel. Execution of the choice will be deferred until `choiceCommit()` is called.  |  
| **helpers** | string  | `[]`  | An array for helper objects. See [Helpers](#helpers) below.  |  
| **dialog**  | string  | `false`  | An object that will be used to fire the JavaScript/CSS dialog. See [Dialogs](#dialogs) below.  |  
| **debug**  | bool  | `false`   | Set to true to log messages to the console (or firebug). If your browser doesn't support this, there will be alerts instead.  |  

> **NOTE:** **debug** is not available in the minified version. If you need to turn this on, be sure to switch the file reference to the uncompressed `jquery.dirtyforms.js` file. 

## Public Methods

#### ```$('form#my-watched-form').dirtyForms( options )```

Initializes Dirty Forms, overrides any of the default options, and stores the original values of the fields of all of the forms that match or are descendants of the selector. The `scan.dirtyforms` event is triggered for each form that is found. To scan all forms, simply use the `'form'` selector.

```javascript
$('form').dirtyForms();
```

##### options (Optional)

An options object.

```javascript
$('form').dirtyForms({ message: 'You better save first.', dirtyClass: 'sooooooo-dirty'});
```

> For a list of available options, see [Options](#options).


#### `var isDirty = $('form#my-watched-form').dirtyForms('isDirty', excludeHelpers)`

Returns true if any non-ignored elements that match or are descendants of the selector are dirty.

##### excludeHelpers (Optional)

Set to true to exclude helpers from the operation. The default is false.


#### `$('form#my-watched-form').dirtyForms('setClean', excludeIgnored, excludeHelpers)`

Marks all fields that match the selector (or are descendants of the selector) clean. Also calls the `setClean` method of all nested helpers. In other words, removes the `dirtyClass` and resets the state so any changes from the current point will cause the form to be dirty. If the operation marks all elements within a form clean, it will also mark the form clean even if it is not included in the selector.

##### excludeIgnored (Optional)

Set to true to exclude ignored fields from the operation. The default is false.

##### excludeHelpers (Optional)

Set to true to exclude helpers from the operation. The default is false.


#### `$('form#my-watched-form').dirtyForms('rescan', excludeIgnored, excludeHelpers)`

Scans all fields that match the selector (or are descendants of the selector) and stores their original values of any dynamically added fields. Also calls the `rescan` method of all nested helpers. Ignores any original values that had been set previously during prior scans or the `.dirtyForms('setClean')` method. Also synchronizes the dirty state of fields with any changes to the ignore status, which can be helpful if you are styling elements differently if they have the dirty class.

##### excludeIgnored (Optional)

Set to true to exclude ignored fields from the operation. The default is false.

##### excludeHelpers (Optional)

Set to true to exclude helpers from the operation. The default is false.


#### `$.DirtyForms.choiceCommit( event )`

This method should be called after the dialog is closed to commit the choice that was specified in `$.DirtyForms.choiceContinue()`. This method will cascade the call to either `$.DirtyForms.decidingContinue()` or `$.DirtyForms.decidingCancel()` automatically, so there is no need to use them in conjunction with this method.

##### event (Required)

A cancelable event.

> See the [Dialogs](#dialogs) section for an example of how to use this method.


#### `$.DirtyForms.decidingContinue( event )`

This method should be called from the dialog to refire the event and continue following the link or button that was clicked.

##### event (Required)

A cancelable event.

> See the [Dialogs](#dialogs) section for an example of how to use this method.


#### `$.DirtyForms.decidingCancel( event )`

This method should be called from the dialog to indicate not to move on to the page of the button or link that was clicked. Note that this method will automatically cancel the event.

##### event (Required)

A cancelable event.

> See the [Dialogs](#dialogs) section for an example of how to use this method.


#### `$.DirtyForms.isDeciding()`

This method will return true if the dialog has fired and neither `$.DirtyForms.decidingCancel()` or `$.DirtyForms.decidingContinue()` has yet been called. It indicates that the dialog has fired, but the user has not yet made a decision.


## Triggers

#### Form Triggers

Simply bind a function to any of these hooks to respond to the corresponding trigger. The form that triggered the event can be accessed through the `event.target` property.

```javascript
$(document).bind('dirty.dirtyforms', function(event) { 
	// Access the form that triggered the event
    var $form = $(event.target);
});

// Or, bind to a specific form to listen for the event
$('form#my-form').bind('dirty.dirtyforms', function () {
	// Access the form that triggered the event
    var $form = $(event.target);
});
```

**dirty.dirtyforms**: Raised when a form changes from clean state to dirty state.

**clean.dirtyforms**: Raised when a form changes from dirty state to clean state. This may happen when the last element within the form is marked clean using `$('#element-id').dirtyForms('setClean')` or when the user undoes all of their edits.

**scan.dirtyforms**: Raised after the form is scanned for new fields (whether during initialization or when subsequently calling `.dirtyForms()`).

**rescan.dirtyforms**: Raised after the form is rescanned for new fields (when calling `.dirtyForms('rescan')`).

**setclean.dirtyforms**: Raised after the `.dirtyForms('setClean')`) method is called or when the user clicks the `reset` button.



#### Document Triggers

Simply bind a function to any of these hooks to respond to the corresponding trigger.

```javascript
$(document).bind('continue.dirtyforms', function() { 
    // ...stuff to do before continuing the user's choice... 
});
```


**cancel.dirtyforms**: Raised when the `$.DirtyForms.decidingCancel()` method is called before it runs any actions. In other words, called when the user chooses cancel on the dialog (but not the browser's built in dialog).

**aftercancel.dirtyforms**: Raised when the `$.DirtyForms.decidingCancel()` method is called after it runs all actions.

**continue.dirtyforms**: Raised when the `$.DirtyForms.decidingContinue()` method is called before it runs any actions. In other words, called when the user chooses continue on the dialog (but not the browser's built in dialog).

**defer.dirtyforms**: Raised prior to showing the dialog box to the user. Useful for accessing elements on the page prior to showing the dialog.

**refire.dirtyforms**: Raised before the original event is re-fired after a user chooses to leave the page. Passes the event that will be re-fired as the second parameter (this event is the first parameter). This event is useful if you need to do things like save data back to fields which is normally part of event propagation - ala TinyMCE.

**beforeunload.dirtyforms**: Non-cancelable event, raised prior leaving the page which may happen either as result of user selection if forms were dirty, or due to a normal page exit of no changes were made.

**bind.dirtyforms**: Raised before event binding (the first time that `.dirtyForms()` is called), allowing customization of event handlers. A common usage is to interoperate with IFrames. See [Customizing Event Handlers](#customizing-event-handlers) for details.


## Selectors

**:dirty** will select all non-ignored elements with the dirty class attached. For example, `form:dirty` would select all non-ignored forms that are currently dirty.

**:dirtylistening** will select all elements that has the listening class attached. This will be all forms that are currently listening for changes.

**:dirtyignored** will select all elements that are currently ignored by Dirty Forms through the `ignoreSelector`, a helper's `ignoreSelector` or an element or a descendant of an element that has the `$.DirtyForms.ignoreClass` applied.


## Helpers

Dirty Forms was created because the similar plugins that existed were not flexible enough. To provide more flexibility a basic helper framework has been added. With this system you can add in new helper objects which will provide additional ability to check for whether a form is dirty or not.

This is useful when you're using replacement inputs or textarea, such as with TinyMCE or CKEditor. See [Available Helpers](#available-helpers).

#### Available Helpers

- [Always Dirty](https://github.com/NightOwl888/jquery.dirtyforms.helpers.alwaysdirty.dist#readme)
- [CKEditor](https://github.com/NightOwl888/jquery.dirtyforms.helpers.ckeditor.dist#readme)
- [TinyMCE](https://github.com/NightOwl888/jquery.dirtyforms.helpers.tinymce.dist#readme)

#### Custom Helpers

Helpers can be created by implementing and then pushing the helper to the `$.DirtyForms.helpers` array.

```javascript
$.DirtyForms.helpers.push(myHelper);
```

##### Members

#### `isDirty( $node, index )` (Optional)

Should return the dirty status of the helper. You can use jQuery to select all of the helpers within the node and test their dirty status.

```javascript
isDirty: function ($node) {
	var isDirty = false;
	
	// Search for all tinymce elements (either the current node or any nested elements).
	$node.filter(':tinymce').add($node.find(':tinymce')).each(function () {

		if ($(this).tinymce().isDirty()) {
			isDirty = true;
			return true;
		}
		
	});
	
	return isDirty;
}
```


#### `setClean( $node, index, excludeIgnored )` (Optional)

Should reset the dirty status of the helper so `isDirty(form)` will return false the next time it is called.

```javascript
setClean: function ($node) {

	// Search for all tinymce elements (either the current node or any nested elements).
	$node.filter(':tinymce').add($node.find(':tinymce')).each(function () {
		if ($(this).tinymce().isDirty()) {
			//Force not dirty state
			$(this).tinymce().isNotDirty = 1; 
		}
	});

}
```

#### `rescan( $node, index, excludeIgnored )` (Optional)

If the helper requires extra logic in order to track the original state, this method can be used to track the values of any elements that were dynamically added since the last scan or rescan.



#### `ignoreSelector` (Optional Property)

A jQuery selector of any anchor, input, select, or textarea elements to exclude from activating the dialog. This works similarly to putting the `ignoreClass` on a specific element, but can be included with a specific helper.

```javascript
ignoreSelector: '.mceEditor a,.mceMenu a'
```

To respect the way jQuery selectors work, all children of the form as well as the form itself should have your custom `isDirty()` and `setClean()` logic applied.


```javascript
// Example helper, the form is always considered dirty
(function($){
	// Create a new object, with an isDirty method
	var alwaysDirty = {
		// Ignored anchors will not activate the dialog
		ignoreAnchorSelector : '.editor a, a.toolbar',
		isDirty : function($node){
			// Perform dirty check on a given node (usually a form element)
			return true;
		},
		setClean : function($node){
			// Perform logic to reset the node so the isDirty function will return true
			// the next time it is called for this node.

		}
		// To ensure full support with jQuery selectors,
		// make sure to run the action on all descendent
		// children of the node parameter. This is
		// accomplished easily by using the .find() jQuery
		// method.
		//
		// $node.find('.mySelector').each(function(){
		//     Run desired action against the child
		//     node here
		//     doSomething(this);
		// });
		// Run desired action against $(node) to handle the case
		// of a selector for a specific DOM element
		// if ($node.hasClass('.mySelector')) { doSomething(node); }

	}
	// Push the new object onto the helpers array
	$.DirtyForms.helpers.push(alwaysDirty);
})(jQuery);
```

See the [TinyMCE Helper Source Code](https://github.com/snikch/jquery.dirtyforms/blob/master/jquery.dirtyforms/helpers/tinymce.js) for another complete example.

## Dialogs

The default browser dialog can be overridden by setting a new dialog object, and providing implementations for the following members.

#### `fire(message, title)` (Required)

Opens the dialog.

##### message

The main message to show in the dialog.

##### title

The title for the header of the dialog.


#### `bind()` (Optional)

Binds the continue and cancel functions to the correct links. For some dialog frameworks, it is simpler just to do all of the work in the fire function. In that case, this function can be omitted. Note that this function is called immediately after fire is called.

It is important to trap the `ESC` key (character code 27) in the keydown event in order to ensure it doesn't cause erratic behavior.

```javascript
// Trap the escape key and force a close. 
// Cancel it so the dialog framework doesn't intercept it.
$(document).keydown(function(e) {

	// Look for the ESC key
	if (e.keyCode == 27) {
	
		// Cancel the event so it doesn't bubble
		e.preventDefault();
		
		// Close the dialog
		dlg.dialog('close');
		
		// Cancel the decision
		$.DirtyForms.decidingCancel(e);
		
		// Return false
		return false;
	}
	
	// Make sure you don't return false here
});
```


#### `stash()` (Optional)

Stash returns the current contents of a dialog to be refired after the confirmation. Use to store the current dialog (from the application), when it's about to be replaced with the confirmation dialog. This function can be omitted (or return false) if you don't wish to stash anything.

> See the [Modal Dialog Stashing](#modal-dialog-stashing) section for more information.


#### `refire(content, event)` (Optional)

Refire handles closing an existing dialog AND fires a new one. You can omit this method (or return false) if you don't need to use stashing/refiring.

##### content

A string containing the HTML of the object that was placed in the stash.

##### event

The event that triggered the refire (typically a button or anchor click).

> See the [Modal Dialog Stashing](#modal-dialog-stashing) section for more information.


#### `selector` (Optional Property)

A jQuery selector used to select the element that will be cloned and put into the stash. This should be a class or id of a modal dialog with a form in it, not the dialog that Dirty Forms will show its confirmation message in. This property can be omitted if you are not using stashing.

> See the [Modal Dialog Stashing](#modal-dialog-stashing) section for more information.


#### `continueButtonText` (Optional Property)

Although this property is not used by Dirty Forms, you can define it to make it possible for the end user of the dialog module to set the text of the continue button.

If contributing a new dialog module, please include this property and set the default value to `Leave This Page`.


#### `cancelButtonText` (Optional Property)

Although this property is not used by Dirty Forms, you can define it to make it possible for the end user of the dialog module to set the text of the cancel button.

If contributing a new dialog module, please include this property and set the default value to `Stay Here`.


#### `width` (Optional Property)

Although this property is not used by Dirty Forms, you can define it to make it possible for the end user of the dialog module to set the width of the dialog (if the dialog framework supports setting the width through JavaScript).


#### `class` (Optional Property)

Although this property is not used by Dirty Forms, you can define it to make it possible for the end user of the dialog module to set the class of the outermost element of the dialog. This can make it easy for the end user to style the dialog with CSS. Omit this setting if the dialog framework is using themes, since it doesn't make sense to override styles of an existing theme.

#### Dialog Example

```javascript
// Selector is a selector string for dialog content. 
// Used to select the element that will be cloned and put into the stash.
selector : '#facebox .content',

// Fire starts the dialog
fire : function(message, title){
	var content = '<h1>' + title + '</h1><p>' + message + '</p>' + 
		'<p>' +
			'<a href="#" class="' + $.DirtyForms.ignoreClass + ' continue">Continue</a>' +
			'<a href="#" class="' + $.DirtyForms.ignoreClass + ' cancel">Stop</a>' +
		'</p>';
	$.facebox(content);
},

// Bind binds the continue and cancel functions to the correct links. For some dialog
// frameworks, it is simpler just to do all of the work in the fire function.
// In that case, this function can be omitted. Note that this function is called immediately
// after fire is called.
bind : function(){
	$(document).bind('keydown.facebox', function (e) {
		// Intercept the escape key and send the event to Dirty Forms
		if (e.keyCode === 27) {
			$(document).trigger('close.facebox');
            $.DirtyForms.decidingCancel(e);
		}
	});
	$('#facebox .cancel, #facebox .close').click($.DirtyForms.decidingCancel);
	$('#facebox .continue').click($.DirtyForms.decidingContinue);
	$(document).bind('decidingcancelled.dirtyforms', function(){
		$(document).trigger('close.facebox');
	});
},

// Stash returns the current contents of a dialog to be refired after the confirmation
// Use to store the current dialog, when it's about to be replaced with the confirmation dialog.
// This function can be omitted (or return false) if you don't wish to stash anything.
stash : function(){
	var fb = $('#facebox .content');
	return ($.trim(fb.html()) == '' || fb.css('display') != 'block') ?
	   false :
	   fb.clone(true);
}

// Refire handles closing an existing dialog AND fires a new one.
// You can omit this method (or return false) if you don't need to use stashing/refiring.
refire : function(content){
	var rebox = function(){
		$.facebox(content);
		$(document).unbind('afterClose.facebox', rebox);
	}
	$(document).bind('afterClose.facebox', rebox);
},

```

`fire()` accepts a `message` and `title`, and is responsible for creating the modal dialog. Note the two classes on each link. In the `bind()` method you will see that we bind the `$.DirtyForms.decidingCancel(e)` method to the `.cancel` link and the `.close` link, and we bind `$.DirtyForms.decidingContinue(e)` to the `.continue` link. You should bind both `$.DirtyForms.decidingCancel` and `$.DirtyForms.decidingContinue` in the `bind()` method (or alternatively you can create the entire dialog in the `fire()` method).

> Be sure to register the keydown event for the escape key and pass the call on to `$.DirtyForms.decidingCancel(e)` or the default browser fallback will fail when the user hits the escape key.

Alternatively, another pattern is supported for modal dialogs where the continuing execution of the event is not allowed until after the dialog is closed (such as when using jQuery UI dialog in modal mode). The pattern uses a boolean property named `$.DirtyForms.choiceContinue` to indicate the dialog choice and a method named `$.DirtyForms.choiceCommit(e)` to execute the choice. Here is an example of that pattern in action using a modal jQuery UI dialog:

```javascript
$.DirtyForms.dialog = {
	selector: '#unsavedChanges',
	fire: function(message, dlgTitle) {
		$('#unsavedChanges').dialog({title: dlgTitle, width: 400, modal: true});
		$('#unsavedChanges').html(message);
	},
	bind: function() {
		$('#unsavedChanges').dialog('option', 'buttons',
			[
				{
					text: "Leave This Page",
					click: function(e) {
						$.DirtyForms.choiceContinue = true;
						$(this).dialog('close');
					}
				},
				{
					text: "Stay Here",
					click: function(e) {
						$.DirtyForms.choiceContinue = false;
						$(this).dialog('close');
					}
				}
			] 
		).bind('dialogclose', function(e) {
			// Execute the choice after the modal dialog closes
			$.DirtyForms.choiceCommit(e);
		});

		// Intercept the escape key and cancel the event.
		// Calling dialog('close') will fire the 'dialogclose' event,
		// which will in turn commit the choice to Dirty Forms.
		$(document).bind('keydown', function(e) {
			if (e.keyCode == 27) {
				e.preventDefault();
				$.DirtyForms.choiceContinue = false;
                $('#unsavedChanges').dialog('close');
            }
        });
	}
}

// Dynamically add the div element to the page for the dialog (a hidden div).
$('body').append("<div id='unsavedChanges' style='display: none'></div>");
        
```

Note that calling `$.DirtyForms.choiceContinue = false;` isn't strictly necessary as `false` is the default, but is shown in the example to make it more clear. Also note that a choice will always be committed using this method whether the user clicks a button or uses the "X" icon to close the dialog because the `'dialogclose'` event is called in every case the dialog is closed.

The `$.DirtyForms.choiceCommit()` method automatically calls either `$.DirtyForms.decidingCancel()` or `$.DirtyForms.decidingContinue()` depending on the state of `$.DirtyForms.choiceContinue`, so there is no need to call them manually.

If you don't want to use a dialog at all, simply pass in `false` instead of an object. Dirty Forms will then use the default browser dialog.

```javascript
$.DirtyForms.dialog = false;
```

### Modal Dialog Stashing

Stashing is meant for the following scenario.

1. A form is hosted inside a modal dialog.
2. The dialog framework you use doesn't allow overlaying a modal dialog on top of another modal dialog.

You don't need to use stashing if either of the above (or both) of the items don't apply to you.

If you have a form and link which is in a modal dialog (a modal dialog created by some other part of your application) then when the Dirty Forms modal fires, the original modal is removed. So the stash saves the content from the original modal dialog while Dirty Forms shows its modal dialog, and then re-shows the original modal dialog with the edits if the user chooses to stay on the page.

## Event Handler Customization

If you need Dirty Forms to work with either parent or child IFrames, you can attach custom events and override the default event handling code. This is useful if you want to monitor events of an IFrame or change the target frame that is redirected instead of using the default behavior.

You just need to hook the `bind.dirtyforms` event prior to the first call to `.dirtyForms()`. An `events` object is passed as the second parameter and it contains the following methods.

### Event Object Methods

#### `bind(window, document, data)`

Binds all of the events for Dirty Forms.

##### window

The DOM window to use to bind the events to. The default uses the DOM window object from the Dirty Forms context.

##### document

The DOM document to use to bind the events to. The default uses the DOM document object from the Dirty Forms context.

##### data

The event data to be passed along to each of the event handlers. The default is an empty object (`{}`);


#### `onFocus(event)`

The event handler for the `focus` and `keydown` events of each field that matches the `fieldSelector`.

##### event

A jQuery event object containing context from the element that caused the event.


#### `onFieldChange(event)`

The event handler for the `change`, `input`, `propertychange`, and `keydown` events of each field that matches the `fieldSelector`.

##### event

A jQuery event object containing context from the element that caused the event.


#### `onReset(event)`

The event handler for the `reset` event of each form.

##### event

A jQuery event object containing context from the element that caused the event.


#### `onAnchorClick(event)`

The event handler for the `click` event of each anchor that has a valid `href` and is not `target="_blank"`.

##### event

A jQuery event object containing context from the element that caused the event.


#### `onSubmit(event)`

The event handler for the `submit` event of each form.

##### event

A jQuery event object containing context from the element that caused the event.


#### `onBeforeUnload(event)`

The event handler for the `beforeunload` event of the `window` object.

##### event

A jQuery event object containing context from the element that caused the event.


#### `onRefireClick(event)`

Called after the user decides to continue after the dialog is shown (not including the browser dialog).

##### event

A jQuery event object containing context from the element that caused the event.


#### `onRefireAnchorClick(event)`

Called by `onRefireClick()` after attempting to execute the event. If the execution didn't cause the page to redirect or reload, we end up here and the assumption is that the user clicked an anchor.

##### event

A jQuery event object containing context from the element that caused the event.


#### `clearUnload()`

Detaches the `beforeunload` event from the `window` object.


### Example Usage

> IMPORTANT: The handler for `bind.dirtyforms` must be declared before `.dirtyForms()` is called.

```javascript

// Add functionality to an event handler
$(document).bind('bind.dirtyforms', function (ev, events) {
    var showAlert = function(when) {
		alert('hello world ' + when);
	};

    var originalBind = events.bind;

    events.bind = function (ev) {
		showAlert('before');
		originalBind(ev);
		showAlert('after');
	};
});


// Bind additional events to existing handlers
$(document).bind('bind.dirtyforms', function (ev, events) {
    var originalBind = events.bind;

    events.bind = function (window, document, data) {
		originalBind(window, document, data);
		$('button.mybutton').bind('click', onAnchorClick);
	};
});


// Pass data between handlers via events
$(document).bind('bind.dirtyforms', function (ev, events) {
    var originalOnAnchorClick = events.onAnchorClick;
	var originalOnRefireAnchorClick = events.onRefireAnchorClick;

    events.onAnchorClick = function (ev) {
		ev.data.hello = 'Hello there!';
		originalOnAnchorClick(ev);
	};
	events.onRefireAnchorClick = function (ev) {
		// Shows "Hello there!"
		alert(ev.data.hello);
		originalOnRefireAnchorClick(ev);
	};
});


// Watch the top (parent) document for clicks when hosted within an IFrame
$(document).bind('bind.dirtyforms', function (ev, events) {
    events.bind(top, top.document);
});


// Watch the top document for clicks when hosted within an IFrame and
// change the target window depending on whether the user clicked an anchor 
// on the top page. If the anchor within an IFrame is non-local, redirect
// the top browser window instead of within the IFrame.
$(document).bind('bind.dirtyforms', function (ev, events) {
    events.bind(top, top.document, { isTopDocument: true });

	events.onRefireAnchorClick = function (ev) {
        var $a = $(ev.target).closest('[href]'),
            href = $a.attr('href'),
            isLocal = $a[0].host === window.location.host;

        if (ev.data.isTopDocument || !isLocal) {
            // For IFrame and non-local, redirect top document
            $.DirtyForms.dirtylog('Sending top location to ' + href);
            window.top.location.href = href;
        } else {
            $.DirtyForms.dirtylog('Sending location to ' + href);
            window.location.href = href;
        }
    };
});


// With either of the above 2 options, optionally add a helper
// so the dirty state of the top document can be maintained.
// We pass in the true parameter to ignore helpers so we don't
// get a recursive loop.
var topDocumentHelper = {
    isNotTopDocument: window.top !== window.self,
    isDirty: function ($node, index) {
        // Prevent from calling when the window is not in
        // an IFrame and there is no need to execute for every node.
        if (this.isNotTopDocument && index === 0) {
            return $(window.top.document).dirtyForms('isDirty', true);
        }
        return false;
    },
    setClean: function ($node, index, excludeIgnored) {
        if (this.isNotTopDocument && index === 0) {
            $(window.top.document).dirtyForms('setClean', excludeIgnored, true);
        }
    },
    rescan: function ($node, index, excludeIgnored) {
        if (this.isNotTopDocument && index === 0) {
            $(window.top.document).dirtyForms('rescan', excludeIgnored, true);
        }
    }
};
$.DirtyForms.helpers.push(topDocumentHelper);

```
